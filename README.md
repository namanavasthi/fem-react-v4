# Parcel

Parcel is a relatively new bundler for JavaScript projects. Webpack is a fantastic piece of technology and you should definitely consider using it for your large applications; it's been around a long time and has a lot of support.

That being said, Parcel is an amazing tool that zero-config. It works with everything we want to do out of the box. Since this is a class on React and not build processes, this allows us to focus more on React.
